# True Weather
An honest application that really tells you what the weather is like outside

The UI was inspored from the following [design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/7196565/Authentic-Weather?tracking_source=search_projects|weather+app&l=61 ).

## Installation

true-weather does not use any package dependencies.

First of all clone the repository and open the `true-weather.xcodeproj` file.

Wait until the necessary files initialisation is finished, then you can run the application either on Simulator or on a real device with `iOS 16+`.
